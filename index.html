											<p>Bridging the gap of communication</p>
										</header>
										<p>Born and raised in South Vietnam, I moved to the United States for 4 years and completed high school in WA State. I have full professional working proficiency English, limited working proficiency Japanese, and limited working proficiency Vietnamese. For pastimes, I always find delight in a Dazai novel, and a cup of coffee.</p>

										<h2>Interest in IT</h2>
									</header>
									<div class="content">
										<p>The concept of artificial intelligence (A.I.) had always fascinated me. This interest spurred  from various depictions of robots and A.I.s in novels, movies, and games. While I am curious and intrigued with the development of an A.I., specifically one with sentience, the furthest I have gotten in terms of IT experience is a high school elementary web design course, where I studied fundamental basics of HTML.<br />

I chose to study at RMIT for its new and unique T&I and Language program, which is allegedly far more practical than programs offered by other Universities in Vietnam. Furthermore, the University also supports students with their internships with its diverse connection, including Japanese industry leaders in the IT field. And rare are such opportunities that I cannot forego the merits RMIT provides.<br />

It is my goal to not only learn and master the linguistic skills necessary for my T&I profession, but also to familiarize with technical skills that may be of assistance. The world is moving fast. Thus, we must adapt as to not be outpaced.

									<h2>Ideal Job<br/>
									IT Comtor Tester</h2>
								</header>
									<p>An IT comtor (IT communicator) tester focuses more specifically on the linguistic aspect, translating from Japanese to Vietnamese and vice versa for other IT specialists, both oral and written. While specialized IT knowledge is not mandatory, familiarity with the field’s jargon is a must, as well as the ability to identify potential software errors. This job appeals to me as not only will I be bridging communication - an act which all linguists aims for - but also becoming the alpha/beta tester for programs/projects to assure the best user experience. However, it is imperative that I improve my Vietnamese and Japanese language proficiency, and broaden my scope of IT knowledge in order to meet the requirements as I am currently capable of mostly conversational Japanese. In order to do so, I suppose a couple of months of focused studies for the JLPT N2 and some Vietnamese language courses provided by our school would be the ideal solution, as well as introductory courses to IT to build familiarity with the field.

						<h2>My Project
			</h2>
			<p>
			My idea for an IT project is to develop something similar to an AI smart home device called Gatebox. Currently, the Japanese company who made it is partnered with Line, who supplies the AI from another device they had made. This is why there is currently only Japanese language support for Gatebox. My vision for this project is to have a virtual hologram character able to recognize speech and respond just as any other AI would. In addition to functioning like a normal home device, it will act as a companion for those living alone and create a sense of human interaction.

It has been reported that Japan's population is decreasing and the country's deaths are outpacing the amount of births. A 2016 study found that "almost 70 percent of unmarried men and 60 percent of unmarried women are not in a relationship" (thejapantimes, 2016). The introduction of Gatebox certainly does not help the declining state of Japan's population, but by providing language support for other countries with overpopulation, I think that it serves a good purpose.

This device will feature a virtual hologram character of the users’ favorite character, taking advantage of the latest projection technology. The hologram will be projected onto a 2D strip of transparent screen and will work in tandem with motion sensors that track movement and change the position of the character accordingly. The motion sensors would serve only to slightly alter the angle of the character, while the perspective is largely dependent on how 2D images can appear the same in most angles. This will allow us to provide a realistic 3D feeling to the character. The second main feature of this AI device will be the voice recognition program and the synthetic voice used to respond to the user. First, we can train the AI to recognize voices by using an evolutionary algorithm that is mostly based on trial and error. There will be multiple generations of AI’s that are fed audio clips and asked to determine which words are being spoken. At first, it will be difficult for them to get the correct answer, after many generations of mutation and tweaking nodes, we will have an AI that can efficiently put together words from an audio clip.

Next is the development of the voice synthesizer. It will convert the response of the AI into phonemes and then utilize recorded audio of every sound in the English language to simulate speech. However, if we simply use this basic process, it will end up sounding too robotic. Normal human speech contain variations in tone and articulation, something that can be achieved through various means such as concatenation. This is a process in which the machine is preloaded with natural human sounds created from snippets of real life conversation, and can rearrange them into newly constructed sentences. Although this is one of the better methods of producing sounds similar to human speech, we still need to train the AI to be able to piece together the bits and pieces of audio that form a sentence without any weird phonemes being pronounced where it should not be. Lastly, the AI of this device needs to be able to correctly answer questions the user asks it. This may be the most complex part of developing the AI, as it deals with language processing and semantics. Essentially, the AI needs to be able to understand the meaning of the sentence without interpreting it too literally. Building this from scratch would take very long, but fortunately, there are several commercially available AI we can implement such as IBM's Watson. This AI can be fed text and is able to answer questions about it using some combination of word association and knowledge databases. Finally, the device will have a wireless adapter, which allows it to connect to the WiFi and be able to answer questions about the weather and other time-sensitive topics.

The hardware needed to build such a device include several motion detecting sensors, a light projector, screen glass, and perhaps a 3D printer for the plastic frame the device is going to be housed in. We can utilize a Raspberry Pi for our AI and machine learning process, as it has low power requirements and can easily fit within the device. Regarding the software, there are a wide variety of languages used to program AI's, such as Java, Python, and C++. 

Machine learning does involve a fair bit of coding, something which I am not experienced with, therefore I will have to rely on others to assist me during the process of teaching our AI how to perform all the functions mentioned above. I believe there are commonly used algorithms, especially ones having to do with evolutionary AI, that we can refer to during the process of constructing our AI. Other than the programming side of the AI-making process, data analysis is an important part of machine learning, as choosing the right model for our AI can affect how well it performs with the given tasks.

Should this project succeed, others may yet enjoy not only the assistance of a simple helping AI, but also companionship with a friend when one most needs it, without the limitations resulting from the language barrier.
