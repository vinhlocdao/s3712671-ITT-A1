											<p>Bridging the gap of communication</p>
										</header>
										<p>Born and raised in South Vietnam, I moved to the United States for 4 years and completed high school in WA State. I have full professional working proficiency English, limited working proficiency Japanese, and limited working proficiency Vietnamese. For pastimes, I always find delight in a Dazai novel, and a cup of coffee.</p>

										<h2>Interest in IT</h2>
									</header>
									<div class="content">
										<p>The concept of artificial intelligence (A.I.) had always fascinated me. This interest spurred  from various depictions of robots and A.I.s in novels, movies, and games. While I am curious and intrigued with the development of an A.I., specifically one with sentience, the furthest I have gotten in terms of IT experience is a high school elementary web design course, where I studied fundamental basics of HTML.<br />

I chose to study at RMIT for its new and unique T&I and Language program, which is allegedly far more practical than programs offered by other Universities in Vietnam. Furthermore, the University also supports students with their internships with its diverse connection, including Japanese industry leaders in the IT field. And rare are such opportunities that I cannot forego the merits RMIT provides.<br />

It is my goal to not only learn and master the linguistic skills necessary for my T&I profession, but also to familiarize with technical skills that may be of assistance. The world is moving fast. Thus, we must adapt as to not be outpaced.

									<h2>Ideal Job<br/>
									IT Comtor Tester</h2>
								</header>
									<p>An IT comtor (IT communicator) tester focuses more specifically on the linguistic aspect, translating from Japanese to Vietnamese and vice versa for other IT specialists, both oral and written. While specialized IT knowledge is not mandatory, familiarity with the fieldâ€™s jargon is a must, as well as the ability to identify potential software errors. This job appeals to me as not only will I be bridging communication - an act which all linguists aims for - but also becoming the alpha/beta tester for programs/projects to assure the best user experience. However, it is imperative that I improve my Vietnamese and Japanese language proficiency, and broaden my scope of IT knowledge in order to meet the requirements as I am currently capable of mostly conversational Japanese. In order to do so, I suppose a couple of months of focused studies for the JLPT N2 and some Vietnamese language courses provided by our school would be the ideal solution, as well as introductory courses to IT to build familiarity with the field.
